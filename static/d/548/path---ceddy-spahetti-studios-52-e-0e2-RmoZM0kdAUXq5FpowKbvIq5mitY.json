It’s hard for me to articulate\nwhat exactly I mean by that, so for the purpose of this post, I’ll explain a\nsimple example that I’ve come across recently.</p>\n<p>Think of a website, any website. I just thought of Twitter. Now, visit the site\nin mind and locate the footer of the site. There you will most likely see multiple\nlinks, probably some about the product, the company, the legal things, etc. I\nwould also bet there is a statement that looks something along the lines of:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">© &lt;year&gt; &lt;company_name&gt;</code></pre></div>\n<p>Am I right? You may be wondering, “Why is Cedric writing about footer copyright\nnotices?” Let me explain. My current side project is called unearth and recently\nI have been designing and coding the landing page. Now, when I got to the footer,\n<em>I wanted to do things as real as possible</em> and decided to throw in the\naforementioned copyright notice, to make things look legit, you know? This is\nthe crazy part.</p>\n<p>Initially, I put <code class=\"language-text\">© 2019 Unearth</code>. A few minutes later, I thought, “Is that even\nlegal? What is Unearth, I don’t actually own a company by that name.”\nAfter spending a few more minutes looking for inspiration, I decided to change\n“Unearth” to “Unearth Labs” because that’s what Notion (<a href=\"https://notion.so\">https://notion.so</a>) does.</p>\n<p>Any normal person would have left it that and moved on with their life, but not\nme. Seeing the word “Unearth” repeated in the footer right below the logo wasn’t\nsitting right with me, so once again I procrastinated further and sought to fiddle\nwith the copyright text even more.</p>\n<p>Then it occurred to me: I’ve gone through a similar struggle before with a previous\nside project. I went to the site and sure enough, there was some footer text\n(though not a copyright notice) that said “An experiment by Ceddy Spaghetti\nStudios”. When building that previous project, I had saw one of my favorite\nmakers do this on one of their projects so I thought it would be cool if I did\nso as well. I remember now sitting at my desk trying to come up with names of a\nfake company to use and ultimately choosing “Ceddy Spaghetti Studios”.</p>\n<p>Upon this realization, I knew I had the text to complete the copyright notice\nfor unearth’s footer. This, however, came at a cost: I just spent thirty minutes\nof my time which could have been spent going towards developing the actual\nproduct.</p>\n<p>Although this example may seem insignificant in of itself, these type of situations\nhappen all the time when I’m building side projects. I battle with myself over\nthe silliest decisions only to waste time and stall the development, and\nconsequently, the launch of most of my projects. Due to this indecisiveness,\nmore often than not, the side project will go unfinished.</p>\n<p>I was originally going to write this post as a way of documenting and making\nCeddy Spaghetti Studios official (for my own benefit). But I guess this post\nalso serves as a nice reminder and lesson to not stress the little things and\ninstead focus on what really needs to get done.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ceddy Spaghetti Studios","date":"February 17, 2019","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ceddy-spahetti-studios/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/reddits-save-functionality-sucks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reddit's Save Functionality Sucks"}},"next":null}}
