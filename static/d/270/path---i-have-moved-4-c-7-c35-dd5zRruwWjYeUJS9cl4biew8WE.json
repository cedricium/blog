My first blog,\n<em>coffee. code. cedric</em>, was hosted on Medium when that was the cool thing to do.\nI even had a custom domain for my publication before that\n<a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487%0A-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation\">feature was steamrolled</a>.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I really struggled with keeping the blog up-to-date. I kid you not, in\nevery post I would mention something along the lines of, “I know this is long overdue,\nbut from now on, I’m going to start writing a post every x amount of time” which turned\nout to never be true. Not only that, I felt as though I had limited myself in the number\nof topics I could write about since the original blog was geared towards programming and\nComputer Science.</p>\n<p>Thus, when my old domain expired and the link to my Medium publication broke, I decided\nto not fix it and instead told myself that I will host my own blog. Along with that,\nI also made the decision to not limit myself in the type of content I write about. What\ndoes that mean for this blog then? Well, anything goes. Be it related to programming,\nphilosophy, design, or my day, I won’t think twice and worry about whether or not a post\nshould belong on this blog.</p>\n<p>For now, I bid you adieu and I look forward to see where things go from here.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I Have Moved","date":"December 12, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-have-moved/","previous":null,"next":null}}
