There’s something about getting to make whatever you\nwant while also having total ownership of a project that makes building side\nprojects so addicting. I’ve heard it compared to other hobbies such as gaming\nor playing sports. Although many side projects may go unfinished or unreleased,\nI feel as though there is still a lot of experience to gain just from starting\nthe project in the first place. In this post, I will walk you through my process\nof coming up with an idea of what to make, taking said idea and turning it into\nsomething tangible, to putting the project out in the world.</p>\n<!-- talk about how this is my current process, recognizing there are some issues\nwith it and wrap up in the end with how I would improve / fix it -->\n<h4>Idea</h4>\n<p>In order to build something, you first need an idea. I find this to be one of\nthe hardest parts of side projects. This is simply because if there is no idea,\nthere can’t be a project. To get around this potential roadblock, I like to\nexamine my own daily life and see what areas I could possibly speed up or\nimprove. Having intimate knowledge of the problem you’re trying to solve will\nmake building a side project that much more easy.</p>\n<p>Once I have an idea in mind, I like to see what existing solutions already exist.\nNow, if I find more than a few existing projects that solve the same issue that\nI was hoping to tackle, then I ususally will not continue with that project. This\nis one of those situations that I mentioned earlier where I’m sort of peculiar -\nthe fact that there are already projects that try and solve an issue means that      <!-- REVISIT -->\nyour idea has already been validated. I find that if I do try and tackle such\nproblems, I will often mimic the existing projects’ solutions rather than building\nsomething unique. This can be a good practice initially, but I’ve found that\nrelying too much on this method then makes it harder for me to build projects\nwith unique solutions later on.</p>\n<p>Now that I have an idea and know I want to commit to this side project, the next\nthing I do is research what tech stack I will use to turn the idea into a real\nthing. This step assumes you’ve also already determined the area or type of project\nyou are going to make - be it a browser extension, CLI tool, a web or mobile app,\netc. I love JavaScript and thanks to the runtime environment Node.js, I can make\nprojects for almost all types of “areas” (???). With the language selected, I then\nwill decide if I want to use any libraries that could help speed up the development\ntime and if I’m unfamiliar with a particular library, I will read their docs.</p>\n<p>Time for the fun part - coding! With an idea in mind and the right tools selected\nto build said idea, I get to work. Programming can be a double-edged sword when\ncreating a side project: when it’s going well I love it, but when I get stuck on\nan issue that I can’t immediately solve, I also really hate it. Throughout the\ndevelopment process, these two emotions seem to constantly manifest and replace\none another. At times I can feel so defeated by a bug and want to give up entirely\nonly to get the biggest boost of confidence after stepping away and figuring out\nhow to squash the bug. Making side projects can feel like war - it’s essentially\na series of battles composed of wins and losses, me versus my code.</p>\n<p>Eventually I come out victorious and emerge with something that works and solves\nthe original problem. This will almost always be a minimum viable product, or MVP.\nThe MVP serves as the skeleton for the finished product without all the bells and\nwhistles that will eventually make it complete.</p>\n<p>This is the step in the process where I like to start thinking about how I will\nmarket my side project. Like a newborn baby, the project needs a name. This can\nbe as simple or extravagent as you would like - I’ve been on both ends of the\nspectrum. Once a name is selected, I think about branding. What will the main\ncolors of the project be (if applicable)? What graphic or logo can best\nrepresent this project? What font? Having answers to those questions then allows\nme to put my creativity to use. Using design software (I’m a big fan of Sketch),\nI will put together a press kit or package of promotional material (namely good\nlooking graphics) to be used later on for open graph meta tags or product\nlaunches on sites like Product Hunt or Reddit.</p>\n<p>Seem like a long process yet? Luckily, we’re just about done. After my creative\nsprint, I go back to programming and flesh out the MVP. On goes the remaining\nfeatures I thought would be useful and any bug fixes that are critical - there\nare always bugs - do not try to fix them all before ever launching you product.</p>\n<p>By now, I have a finished product and am ready to show it to the world. With the\npress kit I made earlier, I hit up several relevant subreddits to the project I\njust made an create posts that describe what the project is, why I made it, and\nwhere to find it. Posting on Reddit will give my project some exposure and\nfeedback that I can then use to fix or tweak before launching on Product Hunt.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>talk about how this is my current process, recognizing there are some issues\nwith it and wrap up in the end with how I would improve / fix it</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Process of Building Side Projects","date":"December 17, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/building-side-projects/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/advice-for-beginners/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Advice for Beginners"}},"next":null}}
