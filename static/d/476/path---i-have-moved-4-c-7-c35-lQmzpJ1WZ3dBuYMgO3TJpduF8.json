My first blog,\n<em>coffee. code. cedric</em>, was hosted on Medium when that was the cool thing to do.\nI even had a custom domain for my publication before that\n<a href=\"https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487%0A-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation\">feature was steamrolled</a>.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I struggled with keeping the blog up-to-date. In many of my posts,\nI would make commitments to write more often which turned out to never come true.\nNot only that, I felt as though I had limited myself in the number of topics I\ncould write about since the original blog was geared towards programming and\nComputer Science.</p>\n<p>Thus, when my old domain expired and the link to my Medium publication broke, I\ndecided to not fix it and instead told myself that I will host my own blog. Along\nwith that, I also made the decision to not limit myself in the type of content I\nwrite about. What does that mean for this blog then? Well, anything goes. Be it\nrelated to programming, philosophy, design, or my day, I won’t think twice and\nworry about whether or not a post should belong on this blog.</p>\n<p>Although I pretty much failed at having a blog before, I do enjoy writing (even\nif I’m bad at it) and hope this blog will allow me to pursue this passion further.\nSo for now, I bid you adieu and I look forward to see where things go from here.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I Have Moved","date":"December 13, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-have-moved/","previous":null,"next":null}}
