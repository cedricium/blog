Check back\noften for future updates.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Too Much Content, Too Little Time</h3>\n<p>Many Redditors, myself included, like to save posts and comments that make us a\nfeel some type a way. Whether it’s a funny meme, a recipe for a delicious meal,\nor an in-depth programming tutorial, we don’t always have the time to act on the\nmedia we consume. So, with good intentions, we save it for later. The problem\nis: later never comes. Consumption of media has become an all-consuming act and\nrarely do we remember to go back and look at our saved things with what little\ntime we have on our hands.</p>\n<p>That’s when I thought: maybe all we need is a simple nudge or reminder every so\noften that surfaces the content for us, similar to Timehop.</p>\n<p>My solution to this issue of rediscovering saved content is (what I think is\naptly named) Unearth. It’s a service that sends users a personalized newsletter\nwith a handful of their Reddit saves at the frequency of their choice. No longer\ncan we place the blame on our forgetfulness—with Unearth, we can be shown some\nof our Reddit saves as frequently as every day.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.tryunearth.com\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 54.305555555555564%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Unearth homepage\" title=\"\" src=\"/blog/static/7386160fac84e67e0a75aa1d14282c2f/b9e4f/unearth-homepage.png\" srcset=\"/blog/static/7386160fac84e67e0a75aa1d14282c2f/cf440/unearth-homepage.png 148w,\n/blog/static/7386160fac84e67e0a75aa1d14282c2f/d2d38/unearth-homepage.png 295w,\n/blog/static/7386160fac84e67e0a75aa1d14282c2f/b9e4f/unearth-homepage.png 590w,\n/blog/static/7386160fac84e67e0a75aa1d14282c2f/f9b6a/unearth-homepage.png 885w,\n/blog/static/7386160fac84e67e0a75aa1d14282c2f/2d849/unearth-homepage.png 1180w,\n/blog/static/7386160fac84e67e0a75aa1d14282c2f/8d0ff/unearth-homepage.png 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n</a>\n<center>\n  <small>Screenshot of the Unearth homepage.</small>\n</center>\n</div>\n<h3>Why Reddit</h3>\n<p>There are a couple reasons why Reddit was chosen as the initial platform to\nsurface saved content. For starters, I, myself, am a Redditor and have saved\nover 800 items since joining the site seven years ago. The second reason is due\nto Reddit’s own technical limitations. It’s widely known yet not totally\nunderstood that only the most recent thousand saved items can be accessed/viewed.\nOnce you go past those thousand items, the oldest content disappears in order\nto make space for the newer saves.</p>\n<p>A majority of the content I save could be beneficial for me at some point in my\nlife, however, even I know I don’t need all of those saved things. So Unearth’s\npurpose is two-fold: not only does it surface content frequently for you, but\nit also helps you manage your saved things by encouraging you to unsave unneeded\ncontent.</p>\n<p>Although Reddit was initially chosen, the great thing about Unearth is that its\ncore functionality can be extended to many different platforms or services which\noffer access to users’ data. Since showing off Unearth to a handful of people,\nI’ve already had people ask me to extend this to sites like Twitter, Facebook,\nand Hacker News in order to surface their likes and bookmarks.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If Unearth sounds like something you would find useful,\n<a href=\"https://www.tryunearth.com/\">sign up today and give it try</a>. I would love to\nhear your thoughts about the service and any other questions or comments you may\nhave.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Unearth Diary #01: What Is It","date":"February 16, 2020","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/unearth-diary-01-what-is-it/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/just-do-it/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Just Do It"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/unearth-diary-02-how-does-it-work/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Unearth Diary #02: How Does It Work"}}}}
