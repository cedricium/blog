Like many introverts, I steer clear of\nconfrontation and rarely do I post anything intimate on social media. As much as\nI hate to admit it, I also fear criticism and find it hard to differentiate a\ncritique of my work from myself as a person. Because of this, I don’t often\nshare the things I’m working on.</p>\n<p>Sad, but true. I’m working on it though, I promise.</p>\n<p>At the turn of the new year, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CedricAmaya/status/1212565348471328768?s=20\">I tweeted I was going to be more open and vulnerable</a>\nsince I wanted to better myself after a not-so-great 2019.</p>\n<p>So when I came across an Ask Hacker News (Ask HN) thread asking “What interesting\nproblems are you working on?”, I forced myself to contribute to the conversation\nrather than just read all of the comments. What resulted is not what I had\nexpected.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Before delving further into the story, let it be known that the Hacker News\ncommunity isn’t the most subtle when it comes to critiquing others’ work. For\ninstance,\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9224\">there’s the infamous Dropbox comment</a>\namong others.</p>\n<p>To get a better picture of Hacker News as a whole, I highly recommend reading\n<em>The New Yorker</em> article,\n<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-lonely-work-of-moderating-hacker-news\"><em>The Lonely Work of Moderating Hacker News</em></a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, hopefully you can see why it can be intimidating to show off your\nwork on Hacker News, especially as a budding developer like myself. But there’s\na reason why people continue to do so: the power of Hacker News can be immense.\nThe traffic alone to the site you are showcasing is known to be so overwhelming\nthat it causes entire sites to go offline.</p>\n<p>Simply put, it is like a badge of honor to be accepted by the Hacker News crowd.\nAnd because of the decision I made to break out of my usual habit of consuming\nmedia and instead contribute to the Ask HN thread, I was able to get a small\nglimpse of said power.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As teased above, I ended up\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22177077\">commenting about my long-time side project</a>,\nUnearth. At the time of commenting, Unearth was still a bare-bones MVP. The\nwebsite was a simple React application that had no styling besides the landing\npage.</p>\n<p>To my surprise, nobody batted an eye about it. What mattered most was the fact\nthat my app worked and it solved a pain point that users themselves faced. Even\nmore surprising, I was praised for the quick and easy no-BS onboarding process which takes\nless than a minute to complete. As cheesy as it sounds, I was ecstatic. So much\nso to the point I was hooting and hollering.</p>\n<p>As the hours passed, more and more users replied to my comment, many of them\nleaving valuable suggestions and constructive criticism which I made sure to\ntake the time to respond to and make note of for future improvements to Unearth.</p>\n<p>Before commenting, I had done a little marketing on Reddit by answering\nquestions related to Reddit’s save functionality in meta subreddits like r/help,\nr/ideasfortheadmins, and r/beta. After answering the original poster’s question,\nI would then plug Unearth. This had resulted in a grand total of seven users\nsigning up. Of those, only a handful actually completed the onboarding process\nnecessary to receive their personalized newsletters.</p>\n<p>As of today, post-Hacker News comment, the numbers stand at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15,000+ Reddit comments and posts (things) queued for surfacing</li>\n<li>2,000+ things already surfaced and delivered</li>\n<li>400+ emails delivered</li>\n<li>62 users registered and authenticated via Reddit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has been a huge win for someone like myself who never shares their work.\nWhat’s great is this isn’t even close to the end for Unearth—I’m just getting\nstarted. Soon I will get Unearth into the hands of an even larger audience once\nI make actual posts on Show HN, Reddit, and Product Hunt rather than commenting.</p>\n<p>What I find most intriguing about this entire experience is I knew all of this\ncould happen. I have read countless of other stories similar to this one and I\nknew what I needed to do in order to make it happen, I just never did.</p>\n<p>Having recently read James Clear’s <em>Atomic Habits</em>, I now know this is what he\nrefers to as\n<a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/taking-action\">“being in motion” as opposed to “taking action”</a>.</p>\n<p>Moral of the story is this: just do it. Really. You will be surprised by the\nresults, and you will never know unless you put in the effort. So just do it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Just Do It","date":"February 10, 2020","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/just-do-it/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/searching-git-history/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Searching Git History"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/unearth-diary-01-what-is-it/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Unearth Diary #01: What Is It"}}}}
