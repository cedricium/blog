Topics will include the motivation behind building Unearth,\nwhat it is, how it works, and the technology powering the service to name a few.\nCheck back often for future updates.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Unearth is a service that sends users a personalized newsletter with a handful\nof their Reddit saves at the frequency of their choice.\n<a href=\"../unearth-diary-01-what-is-it\">Read the first article</a>\nin this series to get a better understanding of what Unearth is.</p>\n<p>New users can join by visiting the Unearth homepage:\n<a href=\"https://www.tryunearth.com\">www.tryunearth.com</a>.</p>\n<p>From there, signing up is as simple as clicking the “Get Started” button. This\nauthenticates users via Reddit using the OAuth 2 protocol and authorizes Unearth\nto use their Reddit information (namely, their Reddit id, username, and saved\nthings).</p>\n<p>Assuming they’ve never joined Unearth before, users are then walked through a\nsimple three-step onboarding process. This consists of gathering their email,\npreferred frequency for newsletters (daily, weekly, or monthly), and finally,\nsyncing their Reddit saves with Unearth. Even with a thousand saved items, this\nentire process is very quick, usually taking less than a minute.</p>\n<p>Once onboarding is complete, users are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>sent their first Unearth newsletter containing five of their saved things</li>\n<li>displayed the date of their first scheduled newsletter</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From this point on, users do not need to do anything else. Depending on the\npreferred frequency, they will either receive their scheduled newsletters every\nday, every Monday, or every 15th of the month. Again, these Unearth newsletters\nare personalized, containing only links that they themselves have saved.</p>\n<p>If a user would like to update their email or frequency preference or delete\ntheir account and all associated data entirely, they can do so by visiting the\nAccount page.</p>\n<div>\n    \n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/blog/static/e46e872166d51b66579a5c84071d40c2/b12db/account-page.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 68.30985915492958%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Example Unearth Account page\" title=\"\" src=\"/blog/static/e46e872166d51b66579a5c84071d40c2/b9e4f/account-page.png\" srcset=\"/blog/static/e46e872166d51b66579a5c84071d40c2/cf440/account-page.png 148w,\n/blog/static/e46e872166d51b66579a5c84071d40c2/d2d38/account-page.png 295w,\n/blog/static/e46e872166d51b66579a5c84071d40c2/b9e4f/account-page.png 590w,\n/blog/static/e46e872166d51b66579a5c84071d40c2/f9b6a/account-page.png 885w,\n/blog/static/e46e872166d51b66579a5c84071d40c2/b12db/account-page.png 994w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n  <center>\n    <small>Screenshot of the Account page.</small>\n  </center>\n</div>\n<p>The main focus of Unearth is tackling the issue of rediscovering and managing\nsaved content.
