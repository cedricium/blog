There‚Äôs something about getting to make whatever you\nwant while also having total ownership of a project that makes building side\nprojects so addicting. I‚Äôve heard it compared to other hobbies such as gaming\nor playing sports. Although many side projects may go unfinished or unreleased,\nI feel as though there is still a lot of experience to gain just from starting\nthe project in the first place. In this post, I will walk you through my process\nof coming up with an idea of what to make, taking said idea and turning it into\nsomething tangible, to putting the project out in the world.</p>\n<!-- talk about how this is my current process, recognizing there are some issues\nwith it and wrap up in the end with how I would improve / fix it -->\n<h4>Coming Up with an Idea üí°</h4>\n<p>In order to build something, you first need an idea. I find this to be one of\nthe hardest parts of side projects. This is simply because if there is no idea,\nthere can‚Äôt be a project. To get around this potential roadblock, I like to\nexamine my own daily life and see what areas I could possibly speed up or\nimprove. Having intimate knowledge of the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve will\nmake building a side project that much more easy.</p>\n<h4>Preliminary Research üßê</h4>\n<p>Once I have an idea in mind, I like to see what existing solutions already exist.\nNow, if I find more than a few existing projects that solve the same issue that\nI was hoping to tackle, then I ususally will not continue with that project. This\nis one of those situations that I mentioned earlier where I‚Äôm sort of peculiar -\nthe fact that there are already projects that try and solve an issue means that      <!-- REVISIT -->\nyour idea has already been validated. I find that if I do try and tackle such\nproblems, I will often mimic the existing projects‚Äô solutions rather than building\nsomething unique. This can be a good practice initially, but I‚Äôve found that\nrelying too much on this method then makes it harder for me to build projects\nwith unique solutions later on.</p>\n<h4>Choosing a Tech Stack ü•û</h4>\n<p>Now that I have an idea and know I want to commit to this side project, the next\nthing I do is research what tech stack I will use to turn the idea into a real\nthing. This step assumes you‚Äôve also already determined the area or type of project\nyou are going to make - be it a browser extension, CLI tool, a web or mobile app,\netc. I love JavaScript and thanks to the runtime environment Node.js, I can make\nprojects for almost all types of ‚Äúareas‚Äù (???). With the language selected, I then\nwill decide if I want to use any libraries that could help speed up the development\ntime and if I‚Äôm unfamiliar with a particular library, I will read their docs.</p>\n<h4>Coding ‚Üí MVP ü¶¥</h4>\n<p>Time for the fun part - coding! With an idea in mind and the right tools selected\nto build said idea, I get to work. Programming can be a double-edged sword when\ncreating a side project: when it‚Äôs going well I love it, but when I get stuck on\nan issue that I can‚Äôt immediately solve, I also really hate it. Throughout the\ndevelopment process, these two emotions seem to constantly manifest and replace\none another. At times I can feel so defeated by a bug and want to give up entirely\nonly to get the biggest boost of confidence after stepping away and figuring out\nhow to squash the bug. Making side projects can feel like war - it‚Äôs essentially\na series of battles composed of wins and losses, me versus my code.</p>\n<p>Eventually I come out victorious and emerge with something that works and solves\nthe original problem. This will almost always be a minimum viable product, or MVP.\nThe MVP serves as the skeleton for the finished product without all the bells and\nwhistles that will eventually make it complete.</p>\n<h4>Break from Code - Design Time üé®</h4>\n<p>This is the step in the process where I like to start thinking about how I will\nmarket my side project. Like a newborn baby, the project needs a name. This can\nbe as simple or extravagent as you would like - I‚Äôve been on both ends of the\nspectrum. Once a name is selected, I think about branding. What will the main\ncolors of the project be (if applicable)? What graphic or logo can best\nrepresent this project? What font? Having answers to those questions then allows\nme to put my creativity to use. Using design software (I‚Äôm a big fan of Sketch),\nI will put together a press kit or package of promotional material (namely good\nlooking graphics) to be used later on for open graph meta tags or product\nlaunches on sites like Product Hunt or Reddit.</p>\n<h4>Wrapping Up üéÄ</h4>\n<p>Seem like a long process yet? Luckily, we‚Äôre just about done. After my creative\nsprint, I go back to programming and flesh out the MVP. On goes the remaining\nfeatures I thought would be useful and any bug fixes that are critical - there\nare always bugs - do not try to fix them all before ever launching you product.</p>\n<h4>Launching üöÄ</h4>\n<p>By now, I have a finished product and am ready to show it to the world. With the\npress kit I made earlier, I hit up several relevant subreddits to the project I\njust made an create posts that describe what the project is, why I made it, and\nwhere to find it. Posting on Reddit will give my project some exposure and\nfeedback that I can then use to fix or tweak before launching on Product Hunt.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Looking Ahead üî≠</h4>\n<p>After having gone through this entire process several times and starting the\nprocess but not finishing many more times, I feel as though there is room\nfor improvement.</p>\n<p>Firstly, deciding whether or not to build something based on the number of\nexisting projects is kind of silly. Even if there are many solutions out there,\nyour take and solution to the problem is unique and therefore could end up\nbeing a better solution than all of the other projects.</p>\n<p>Lastly, it‚Äôs really important to get your project out in the hands of the public\nas soon as possible as this will significantly improve your chances of actually\ncompleting it. Too many times to count have I worked on a project in isolation\nwithout letting others try it which resulted in a ‚Äúfailed‚Äù launch. This is simply\ndue to the fact that I assumed I knew what people would want, rather than actually\nletting them tell me. A costly mistake if you‚Äôre hoping to have users other than\nyourself use the project.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, I hope to work on the above issues while also continually\nimproving the process I‚Äôve since been following. I feel as though the side\nprojects I‚Äôve made up until this point have been quite small in scope, so in the\nfuture I also plan on taking on larger problems that require more complex\nsolutions. Finally, I would love to make something that I can monetize and earn\nsome extra side income. That‚Äôs definitely a goal for 2019.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Process of Building Side Projects","date":"December 17, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/building-side-projects/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/advice-for-beginners/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Advice for Beginners"}},"next":null}}
