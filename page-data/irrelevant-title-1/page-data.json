David Perell sums it up nicely: “The biggest\nmistake new Internet writers is writing about what they think other people want\nto read instead of following their obsessions.”<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Any time I start something new, I seek out the work of others who are successful\nand try to mimic their work. For example, when designing the landing page for\nUnearth I found inspiration in the Netlify and Slab websites.</p>\n<p>It seems as though writing is no different. I think if I am going to improve, I\nmust mimic my favorite authors’ work while applying it to my own.</p>\n<p>I honestly don’t even know where I am going with this. This writing thing is\nmaking me frustrated so I’m just going to publish and call it a day. 🤬</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1294764847607844864\">https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1294764847607844864</a></li>\n</ol>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Irrelevant Title #1","date":"August 23, 2020","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/irrelevant-title-1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-desired-writing-style/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Desired Writing Style"}},"next":null}}}
