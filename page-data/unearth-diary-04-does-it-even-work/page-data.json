Unearth is a service that surfaces users’ Reddit saves using\npersonalized emails at the frequency of their choice—think of it like Timehop\nfor Reddit saves.</p>\n<h2>A Poor Man’s Attempt at Determining User Sentiment Based Solely on Email Metrics</h2>\n<p>It’s an interesting (though mostly unsettling) feeling when the product you\nmade no longer seems to be working, at least not as you had intended. That’s\nhow I feel with Unearth. Its goal seemed simple: surface the hundreds of things\nI had saved on Reddit and assist me with removing some of that content.</p>\n<p>As much as I hate to admit it, it seems as though Unearth doesn’t work; at\nleast not for me personally. I would often ignore the Unearth emails entirely\nand rarely would I click any of the links in the email if I did open it in the\nfirst place. I started to catch on to the fact that Unearth wasn’t as useful as\nI had wished when I found myself deleting my own personalized emails as soon as\nthey hit my inbox. But then people\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22177077\">told me it was a cool idea</a>, so\nmaybe I am just the odd one out.</p>\n<p>Without talking to my users directly, it’s hard to tell. I wonder if the\nnumbers paint a different picture? As a naturally-curious individual, I set out\nto determine Unearth users’ sentiments towards the platform based solely on the\nemail metrics provided by Sendgrid.</p>\n<h3>Email Metrics</h3>\n<p>Full disclosure: I connected Unearth to Sendgrid on around October 20, 2019. At\nthat time, there would have been only ~2 users/accounts: my own and my\ngirlfriend’s (basically a test account). I’m not going to try and remove those\nnumbers from the coming metrics since the test account basically went unused\nand I consider my account as an actual Unearth user.</p>\n<p>They say a picture is worth a thousands words, so I’ll just drop a screenshot\nof my Sendgrid dashboard containing the most relevant information.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0 1.5rem\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/blog/static/278dc31a2faa0f2db0f699a3ad443bd4/187fa/sendgrid-stats.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 52.93132328308208%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Sendgrid stats dashboard for Unearth since its inception.\" title=\"Sendgrid stats dashboard for Unearth since its inception.\" src=\"/blog/static/278dc31a2faa0f2db0f699a3ad443bd4/fcda8/sendgrid-stats.png\" srcset=\"/blog/static/278dc31a2faa0f2db0f699a3ad443bd4/12f09/sendgrid-stats.png 148w,\n/blog/static/278dc31a2faa0f2db0f699a3ad443bd4/e4a3f/sendgrid-stats.png 295w,\n/blog/static/278dc31a2faa0f2db0f699a3ad443bd4/fcda8/sendgrid-stats.png 590w,\n/blog/static/278dc31a2faa0f2db0f699a3ad443bd4/efc66/sendgrid-stats.png 885w,\n/blog/static/278dc31a2faa0f2db0f699a3ad443bd4/c83ae/sendgrid-stats.png 1180w,\n/blog/static/278dc31a2faa0f2db0f699a3ad443bd4/187fa/sendgrid-stats.png 1194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  <center>\n    <small>Sendgrid stats dashboard for Unearth since its inception.</small>\n  </center>\n</div>\n<p>So what do these graphs and numbers tell us? I’m not entirely sure myself. From\nthe little research I’ve done so far, I have learned there are several key\nperformance indicators (or KPIs) that are beneficial in understanding how well\none’s emails are doing. As I mentioned earlier, because Unearth’s emails and\ntheir contents are personalized to the receiver, I’m not sure how applicable\nthese KPIs are for measuring Unearth’s success. We’ll run with them anyways.</p>\n<p>The KPIs we’ll be examining in this article are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>open rate (OR): “number of emails opened compared to the total amount\ndelivered”</li>\n<li>click-through rate (CTR): “number of clicks on the links”</li>\n<li>click-to-open rate (CTOR): “number of clicks with respect to the number of\nopenings…measuring the level of interaction”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using the stats obtained from Sendgrid, let’s calculate the aforementioned KPIs\nfor Unearth:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OR: 413 emails opened / 820 emails delivered = <strong>50.37%</strong></li>\n<li>CTR: 118 unique links clicked / 820 emails delivered = <strong>14.39%</strong></li>\n<li>CTOR: 118 unique links clicked / 413 emails opened = <strong>28.57%</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Analysis</h3>\n<p>Without any reference, these percentages are useless. A little googling later\nand I found several resources that outline what “good” or the average KPIs are\nacross various industries. According to Mailchimp (as calculated by their\ncustomers’ campaigns with more than 1,000 subscribers), the <strong>average open rate\nis 21.33%</strong>. Compared to Unearth’s roughly 50%, that seems pretty good on\nour part!</p>\n<p>Likewise, they analyzed the <strong>average click rate to be a mere 2.62%</strong>. Remember\nUnearth’s click rate is about 14%, again well above average.</p>\n<p>Sendgrid determined the <strong>aggregate click-to-open rate in 2018 was 10.1%</strong>.\nLike the other two KPIs we’ve examined, Unearth beats this at a CTOR of about\n29%.</p>\n<h3>Verdict</h3>\n<p>As the subtitle suggests, this comparison between Unearth’s KPIs and the\naverage KPIs of Mailchimp’s and Sendgrid’s customers isn’t exactly\napples-to-apples. It does, however, give me faith that Unearth is still helping\nothers even if it doesn’t fit my own wants or wishes. At the end of the day,\nthis research has proven to me the platform does in fact seem to be working and\nthere is no reason to shut it down now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>References:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.mailup.com/2017/01/email-metrics/\">https://blog.mailup.com/2017/01/email-metrics/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/resources/email-marketing-benchmarks/\">https://mailchimp.com/resources/email-marketing-benchmarks/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ahoy.sendgrid.com/rs/294-TKB-300/images/18_SendGrid_Global_Email_Benchmark_Report.pdf\">https://ahoy.sendgrid.com/rs/294-TKB-300/images/18_SendGrid_Global_Email_Benchmark_Report.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-are-the-average-click-and-read-rates-for-email-campaigns/\">https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-are-the-average-click-and-read-rates-for-email-campaigns/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sendgrid.com/blog/click-to-open-rate-how-relevant-is-my-email/\">https://sendgrid.com/blog/click-to-open-rate-how-relevant-is-my-email/</a></li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":4,"frontmatter":{"title":"Unearth Diary #04: Does It Even Work?","date":"March 12, 2020","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/unearth-diary-04-does-it-even-work/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/always-searching-for-answers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Always Searching for Answers"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine-reading-list/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine Reading List"}}}}}
