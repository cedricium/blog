The problem is I end up\nchoosing those exact topics since they are easy to write about and take little\neffort on my part.</p>\n<p>I bring this is up is because I haven’t been particularly happy with the quality\nof my recent posts. When I started this challenge, the only rule put in place\nwas the need to write every day.</p>\n<p>David Perell said it best in a recent tweet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Writing a lot won’t make you a better writer.</p>\n<p>If it did everybody who answers 100 emails per day would write like Hemmingway\n[sic].</p>\n<p>If you want to improve your writing, listen to critical feedback, read great\nbooks, and spend a lot of time <em>re-writing</em> your sentences.<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I first developed the interest to start writing I had a specific goal in\nmind: I wanted to write more informative pieces backed with evidence from\noutside resources in the hopes of teaching my readers something.</p>\n<p>This desire to teach and have a more authoritative writing style was heavily\ninfluenced by Julian Shapiro’s\n<a href=\"https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro\"><em>Writing Well</em></a> guide. In it, he\nexplains the benefits of writing, some of which include becoming “…a better\nall-around thinker” and getting to “…send strangers down paths they badly\nneeded.”</p>\n<p>I’m currently reading Nadia Eghbal’s latest book, <em>Working in Public: The Making\nand Maintenance of Open Source Software</em>, and she does an amazing job of doing\njust that. The book is essentially a collection of essays, each more informative\nthan the next, and containing lots of notes from her years-long research on the\ntopic.</p>\n<p>I feel as though I never quite mastered this particular style of writing, which\nis similar to the kind of essays one would be required to write in school. I\nguess my end goal is ultimately to be a creator whose work is helpful to others.</p>\n<p>At this point, I’m worried my daily writing challenge may be doing more harm\nthan good, or at the least not having the intended effect of driving me towards\nbecoming a better writer. Says Julian on writers who publish on a fixed\nschedule:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Efficient reading:</p>\n<p>Writers who post frequently (2x/wk) are rarely worth reading consistently.</p>\n<p>I read for insights. And no writer can generate profound insights on a fixed\nschedule.</p>\n<p>I aggregate writers who publish sporadically. When they post, they truly have\nsomething to say.<sup>2</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For my desired writing style, this makes sense: If I have to write every day,\nthen I will not have time to research topics. So I may need to rethink my\nwriting challenge, at the least altering how often I publish new posts.</p>\n<p>I think this somewhat meta idea on the benefits of writing could make for a\ngreat first essay so I may explore it further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1297346170964959233\">https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1297346170964959233</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1282025817589952513\">https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1282025817589952513</a></li>\n</ol>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"My Desired Writing Style","date":"August 22, 2020","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/my-desired-writing-style/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/code-review-checklist/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Code Review Checklist"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/irrelevant-title-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Irrelevant Title #1"}}}}}
