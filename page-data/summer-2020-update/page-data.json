Usually these absences are due\nto not much going on in my life; there‚Äôs nothing for me to write about.</p>\n<p>These last three-ish months are different however. Instead of too little going\non, a lot has happened and I have been too busy to sit down and write about it.\nI found myself with some spare time this Sunday so I figured I would quickly\noutline the major things that have happened.</p>\n<h3>Unearth 2.0 üõ†</h3>\n<p>A majority of my blog posts since February have been about my long-time side\nproject, Unearth. At the time, Unearth was a service that would surface a\nhandful of users‚Äô Reddit saves in the form of an email. It was a fun project to\nbuild and when shared online, others thought the idea was neat as well.</p>\n<p>Like all my side projects, I built Unearth to scratch my own itch.\nUnfortunately, Unearth in its current form at the time just wasn‚Äôt what I was\nlooking for. Around the same time of having this realization, it became\nincreasingly clear to me that other Redditors wanted more out of their Reddit\nsaves as well: they were asking for ways to manage and search their saves rather\nthan a way to surface saves like Unearth was built to do.</p>\n<p>I then went back to the drawing board and decided to start coding a new project\nfrom scratch titled Unearth 2.0. You can actually see a glimpse of this in my\n<em>Fooled by ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù Scrollbars</em> post.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tryunearth.com/about\">Unearth 2.0 is what I had originally envisioned the project would be</a>.\nThe reason I was never able to get it off the ground in the first place was\nbecause I got stuck designing the app. This time around, however, I decided to\ncopy a tried-and-true app design, pulling inspiration from Pocket.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0\">\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/blog/static/b86f59e83abd7ba7d03ef204ad58c091/074aa/pocket-vs-unearth.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 28.05460750853242%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABHklEQVQY0z1Qy2rDQAz0//9Eoace2l/oodDecihpIHUh0EJxiHc3a+/T3sdU2uIIhIQYzYzUuRgRYsCyLMg5o5TSKmrF5arR/w7guJiIQc2wPsJYjyVlxCXdsj87yMmj097DOgdrLSKT+4AQAkplmhWwPdUK4wI86UilMQznhve0GygZK74PGH+O6HjABNM0NYC1/+QLuQ654mRLc+icR1pXwgQIIaHUFcZYJHLKoeTYstuUtNat8rkbSEwGTy+71q8ptXc4umYkQt5jETbD8bHf4+uTHAop25DJEi1x1NruxXgZ8XB33/rtx0wipMI0z61nEY733RtO/QEdkzDZTAD+IZNtIK0snh9fUUu+ibBDSefya9jIZkILDaMN/gCf3c4A+SLXUQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Comparison of Pocket and Unearth\" title=\"Comparison of Pocket and Unearth\" src=\"/blog/static/b86f59e83abd7ba7d03ef204ad58c091/fcda8/pocket-vs-unearth.png\" srcset=\"/blog/static/b86f59e83abd7ba7d03ef204ad58c091/12f09/pocket-vs-unearth.png 148w,\n/blog/static/b86f59e83abd7ba7d03ef204ad58c091/e4a3f/pocket-vs-unearth.png 295w,\n/blog/static/b86f59e83abd7ba7d03ef204ad58c091/fcda8/pocket-vs-unearth.png 590w,\n/blog/static/b86f59e83abd7ba7d03ef204ad58c091/efc66/pocket-vs-unearth.png 885w,\n/blog/static/b86f59e83abd7ba7d03ef204ad58c091/c83ae/pocket-vs-unearth.png 1180w,\n/blog/static/b86f59e83abd7ba7d03ef204ad58c091/074aa/pocket-vs-unearth.png 2930w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<center>\n  <small>Comparison of Pocket (left) and Unearth (right).</small>\n</center>\n</div>\n<p>In these past few months I‚Äôve been able to design and develop this <a href=\"https://github.com/tryunearth\">full-stack\nweb application</a>\nthat includes a RESTful API, single-page web app, and a marketing website. I‚Äôve\nsince soft-launched Unearth 2.0 by posting in r/SideProject and recommending it\nin various subs on Reddit where I think users might find it beneficial.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, there are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>165 users registered</li>\n<li>66K Reddit saves synced</li>\n<li>107 custom tags created</li>\n<li>454 saves tagged</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sunsetting Old Unearth üåÖ</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, surfacing Reddit saves using emails wasn‚Äôt as useful as I\nhad hoped, at least not for me personally. Because there weren‚Äôt that many\npeople using the service to begin with, I made the hard decision to pull the\nplug on that version of Unearth (I call it Unearth Surfacer or Unearth 1.0).</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the database schema used in Unearth 2.0 could allow for the same\nsurfacing technique to be used in the event that I wanted to re-engineer that\nas an additional feature.</p>\n<h3>Goodbye Menlo Security üëã</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt think I ever mentioned my work in any blog posts, but up until the end\nof May I had been working at a cybersecurity startup called Menlo Security. I\nhad been there for a little over 3 years doing a Software Development Engineer\nin Test co-op. This was a great position because it offered flexible work hours\nwhich gave me the time to also go to school.</p>\n<p>I primarily coded in Python but did use JavaScript/Node a few times for some proof-of-concept browser automation scripts. Many of my projects were based on\ndeveloping tests or fixing infrastructure for the dev team.</p>\n<p>Despite their interest in bringing me on full-time, I had to decline because my\nheart has always been to work directly on a product as part of a dev team.</p>\n<h3>(Almost) Done with Lambda School üéì</h3>\n<p>Like Menlo, I don‚Äôt think I ever mentioned attending Lambda School in my blog,\nalthough I do know it is listed on my personal site. Since February of 2019, I\nhave been doing Lambda‚Äôs Full Stack Web Development part-time program. This\nmeans having class in the evenings from 6-9pm PST, Monday through Friday.</p>\n<p>I should have finished the program near the end of April but due to COVID-19 and\nexhaustion, I decided to take a six week hiatus.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve since started back up with the program and am now only 3 weeks away from\nfinally graduating! Finishing the program has been a long time coming and it‚Äôs\nonly been even more difficult recently because I‚Ä¶</p>\n<h3>Joined the Herd üêÆ</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cedricamaya_im-thrilled-to-announce-that-this-summer-activity-6638885923692118016-Kxec\">I am currently a Software Engineering Intern at Moogsoft</a>,\nwhose mascot is a cow and whose employees are colloquially known as ‚Äúthe herd‚Äù.\nThis is your typical summer tech internship that demands 40-hour work weeks,\nhence the reason why doing Lambda in the evenings has been more difficult than\nusual.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I am ecstatic about what I am doing at Moogsoft and would be lying\nif I said I wouldn‚Äôt be sad to not receive an offer letter after the internship.</p>\n<p>Originally the internship was to take place at the company‚Äôs headquarters in San Francisco, but due to the Bay Area‚Äôs continued shelter-in-place orders,\nMoogsoft\ndecided to make it remote.</p>\n<p>I am working on the front-end team whose focus is developing the UI for the\ncompany‚Äôs latest product, a cloud-based SaaS monitoring and alert application\ncalled Moogsoft Express. The web app is a single-page Vue application that\nutilizes common Vue libraries like Vue Router and Vuex for handling browser\nnavigation and global store, respectively.</p>\n<p>Since starting on June 15th, I have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>improved build time performance by reducing bundle size</li>\n<li>updated old dependencies</li>\n<li>fixed small bugs</li>\n<li>migrated charts from D3 to FusionCharts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the time of writing, I‚Äôm halfway done with the internship and am looking\nforward to the remaining five weeks ahead.</p>","timeToRead":4,"frontmatter":{"title":"Summer 2020 Update","date":"July 26, 2020","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/summer-2020-update/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/fooled-by-magic-scrollbars/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fooled By \"Magic\" Scrollbars"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/becoming-a-better-writer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Writing to Become a Better Writer"}}}}}
