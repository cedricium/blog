Generally\nspeaking, I’m uncomfortable with not knowing what’s to come or how to do\nsomething, so I seek out answers to those unknowns.</p>\n<p>As a software developer, I rely heavily on Google to look up solutions to any\nchallenges or issues I face when writing code. Majority of the time, someone\nelse also came across the same issue and as such, an answer is typically posted\nsomewhere on the web.</p>\n<p>As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized this same approach of searching for answers\ncan also be applied to life’s own problems. For example, here is a random list\nof some of my own Google searches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>doing stuff alone terrifies me</li>\n<li>combative to working / cannot focus on work</li>\n<li>want to write but unsure what to write about</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This very blog post was inspired by a homonymous Google search: “always\nsearching for answers”. But what happens when one applies this resourcefulness\nto all aspects of their life? The short answer as it applies to me: nothing\ngets done.</p>\n<h3>Why Do I Do This</h3>\n<p>There are several reasons I can think of as to why I’m always searching for\nanswers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I struggle with wanting to do things the “best” way by following “best\npractices”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this is possibly due to a lack in confidence in my own abilities</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>want to save myself from failing if I can just do it right the first time</p>\n<ul>\n<li>because I’m scared of failing, looking for answers is like an avoidance\ntactic</li>\n<li>I also forget that failing is the key to success so I’m not doing myself\nany favors by “protecting” myself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I’m lazy: don’t want to discover the solutions myself; would rather use\nsomeone elses findings</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What’s The Problem</h3>\n<p>When I find myself searching for answers to every little nuisance in my life,\nit takes time away from doing the things I actually want to do. As a result, I\nend up feeling stuck because now I’m no longer making any progress. This goes\nagainst a critical phase in\n<a href=\"../advice-for-beginners\">advancing any creative’s skills</a> from novice to\nexpert: “…do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work.”</p>\n<h3>How Can I Fix This</h3>\n<p>Fears aside, I need to start doing what I want to do, regardless of the\noutcomes (be it failure or success). At this point in my journey, results\nshouldn’t matter. Instead, I need to be focused on producing that volume of\nwork in order to close the gap. Rarely does someone who’s wet behind the ears\nstrike gold and produce/develop a highly-regarded piece of work. This is a key\naspect I often overlook when ruminating on my own journey as a developer.</p>\n<p>Since I’ve somehow forgotten Glass’ advice since first reading it a little over\na year ago, I’ve also decided to print out his <em>The Gap</em> quote. The plan is to read it once every day, reminding myself that my current goal is to close that\ngap between taste and talent and to do so through my own efforts.</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Always Searching for Answers","date":"February 26, 2020","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/always-searching-for-answers/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/unearth-diary-03-the-tech-powering-unearth/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Unearth Diary #03: The Tech Powering Unearth"}},"next":null}}}
