In my (limited) experience developing\nthese kind of apps, a user’s operating system rarely hijacks or alters the way\ntheir browser works. Excluding something like <code class=\"language-text\">prefers-color-scheme</code>, most\nanything involving presentation and styling is dictated by the browser itself\nand therefore can be handled using good ol’ CSS—until it can’t. With that in\nmind, you might be able to understand why, then, I was so surprised when I\ndiscovered the phenomenon of the disappearing/reappearing scrollbars on Mac\nmachines.</p>\n<p>Take a minute to imagine yourself as a developer who has been working on a\nside project for countless days, weeks even. At this point in time, you’re\nintimately aware of all aspects of the app; you know the inner workings and\ncore logic like the back of your hand. Furthermore, the design of the app is\ningrained in your brain since surely you’re constantly make tiny tweaks to the\nclient.</p>\n<p>Now, with this picture in mind, imagine the confusion-but-borderline-disgust\nthat overcomes you when suddenly your seemingly perfect app randomly begins\ndisplaying horrendous scrollbars and their gutters. For some, this issue might\nseem minute. But for the person who made zero code changes and for those\nscrollbars to still unexpectedly appear, it would seem like magic.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what happened to me while I was working on my current passion\nproject, Unearth. Consisting of the standard two-column layout (sidebar and\nmain content), Unearth’s height is restricted to <code class=\"language-text\">100vh</code> or the full height of\nthe screen. Both columns can have content that is greater than the full height\nof the screen, however, and when that occurs, it is expected for scrollbars to\nbe displayed. The problem was each column in the layout had its own set of\nalways-shown scrollbar gutters which were not previously there.</p>\n<p>After what seemed like an eternity trying different CSS hacks across a range of\nbrowsers, it suddenly dawned on me the one thing I had changed since first\nlaying eyes on these magic scrollbars.</p>\n<p><em>I had plugged in an external mouse into my computer.</em></p>\n<p>Let that take a minute to sink in.</p>\n<p>Did you think about it? Does it not seem a little bit silly to you that\nplugging in an external mouse would render scrollbars? Personally, I was the\nslightest bit exasperated after I finally realized what the issue was. And to\nbe honest, I still don’t know why this is a preference on Macs (or any other\noperating system for that matter)—if I had to guess, I would probably say it\nhas to do with accessibility. Again, I’m not sure so if you know please share\nthe reason.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0\">\n<video controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"100%\">\n  <source src=\"/blog/b980feb8560e9c9c2d1bd2ae546910c9/magic-scrollbars.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n<center>\n  <small>Demo of the magic scrollbars.</small>\n</center>\n</div>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Fooled By \"Magic\" Scrollbars","date":"May 08, 2020","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/fooled-by-magic-scrollbars/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/quarantine-reading-list/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Quarantine Reading List"}},"next":null}}}
