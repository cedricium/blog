(Ahh, the powers that come with being the one to\nset the rules—but I digress.)</p>\n<p>I woke up this morning around my usual time, 6:00AM sharp. I then immediately\njumped on Twitter to scope out the day’s hottest stocks. For the past three\nmonths I have been trading small-cap stocks using Robinhood (note to self: this\ncould be a good future topic).</p>\n<p>I trade for a couple hours then prepare for my day, doing tasks like eating\nbreakfast, brushing my teeth, and showering. Once finished with all that, I\nstart work right around 9AM.</p>\n<p>Work has been incredibly fun and interesting lately. For the past five weeks or\nso the frontend team has been busy tackling a few different Jira epics that\nencapsulate some cool new features.</p>\n<p>I only stepped away from my work laptop a few minutes ago to start writing this.\nI have a headache from staring at screens all day as I so tend to do. I really\nought to get out of the house more often during this shelter-in-place.</p>\n<p>A combination of a headache and mushy brain after work is the reason why I did\nnot feel like writing.</p>\n<p>But isn’t that the point of a challenge? Nobody said it would be easy, and if it\nwas, everyone would be doing it. Just have to push through!</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Consistency is Hard","date":"August 20, 2020","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/consistency-is-hard/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-new-normal/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The New Normal"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/code-review-checklist/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Code Review Checklist"}}}}}
