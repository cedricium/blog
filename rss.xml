and how it plagues my ability to get anything done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if there’s a word for this, but I enjoy doing things as real as
possible; maybe better put, done by the book. It’s hard for me to articulate
what exactly I mean by that, so for the purpose of this post, I’ll explain a
simple example that I’ve come across recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a website, any website. I just thought of Twitter. Now, visit the site
in mind and locate the footer of the site. There you will most likely see multiple
links, probably some about the product, the company, the legal things, etc. I
would also bet there is a statement that looks something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;© &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;company_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I right? You may be wondering, “Why is Cedric writing about footer copyright
notices?” Let me explain. My current side project is called unearth and recently
I’ve been designing and coding the landing page. Now, when I got to the footer,
&lt;em&gt;I wanted to do things as real as possible&lt;/em&gt; and decided to throw in the
aforementioned copyright notice, to make things look legit, you know? This is
the crazy part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I put &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;© 2019 Unearth&lt;/code&gt;. A few minutes later, I thought, “Is that even
legal? What is Unearth, I don’t actually own a company by that name.”
After spending a few more minutes looking for inspiration, I decided to change
“Unearth” to “Unearth Labs” because that’s what Notion (&lt;a href=&quot;https://notion.so&quot;&gt;https://notion.so&lt;/a&gt;) did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any normal person would have left it at that and moved on with their life, but
not me. Seeing the word “Unearth” repeated in the footer right below the logo
wasn’t sitting right with me, so once again I procrastinated further and sought
to fiddle with the copyright text more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it occurred to me: I’ve gone through a similar struggle before with a previous
side project. I went to the site and sure enough, there was some footer text
(though not a copyright notice) that said, “An experiment by Ceddy Spaghetti
Studios”. When building that previous project, I had seen one of my favorite
makers do this on one of their projects so I thought it would be cool if I did
so as well. I remember now sitting at my desk trying to come up with names of a
fake company to use and ultimately choosing “Ceddy Spaghetti Studios”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon this realization, I knew I had the text to complete the copyright notice
for unearth’s footer. This, however, came at a cost: I just spent thirty minutes
of my time which could’ve been spent going towards developing the core product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this example may seem insignificant in of itself, these type of situations
happen all the time when I’m building side projects. I battle with myself over
the silliest decisions only to waste time and stall the development, and
consequently, the launch of most of my projects. Due to this indecisiveness,
more often than not, the side project will go unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally going to write this post as a way of documenting and making
Ceddy Spaghetti Studios “official” (insert Michael Scott declaring bankruptcy
meme). But I guess this post also serves as a nice reminder and lesson to not
sweat the small stuff and instead focus on what really needs to get done.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reddit's Save Functionality Sucks]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Problem I have been a Redditor for over six years and was a “lurker” for a year before

&lt;p&gt;I have been a Redditor for over six years and was a “lurker” for a year before
even creating my main account. During my time on Reddit, I have come across
amazing content, such as helpful LifeProTips and great book recommendations. When
browsing dozens of posts and reading even more comments every day, it becomes
difficult trying to remember the most memorable content from a week, a month, or
even a year ago. Fortunately, the engineers at Reddit were smart enough to develop
a way to save your favorite posts and comments. Unfortunately, however, the save
functionality is nowhere near functional and is only slightly more useful if
you’re a Premium member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer myself, I understand the need to monetize certain features of
your product in order to grow, but the problem with saving on Reddit is the fact
that the implementation is incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those unaware, saving things on Reddit as a non-Premium member works in the
following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limited to 1000 saved things (posts and comments) total; once the limit is
reached, older things are replaced and essentially deleted from history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saves are stored in reverse chronological order (latest to oldest) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no way whatsoever to filter or sort saved content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no searching capability is provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pagination limit on Reddit site is limited to 25 items, thus requiring users
to use the “Next Page” or “Prev Page” buttons a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the organization of saved content and lack of basic discovery tools like
filtering, searching, and sorting paired with the pagination limit, finding some
specific content becomes a pain with as little as a few dozen saved items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For members with Reddit Premium, some of the outlined pain points are addressed.
For example, organization of saved content is improved with the ability to create
categories (think folders) which allow users to group related content. I’ve also
heard that each category itself has a 1000 item limit rather than a hard 1000
limit for all saved content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are still issues even if users are paying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no discovery tools (filter, search, or sort)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;categories disappear after Premium membership expires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unable to rename or remove categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saves live on old.reddit.com (UI consistency issue if Redditor prefers “new”
Reddit design)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully by now you can see how Reddit’s save feature is not functional from a
user’s perspective. What’s even more interesting in my opinion is the fact that
Reddit has the means to support the missing functionality. I know this because
their public API exposes the necessary endpoints to make it possible. That’s why
I’m creating a service that will improve Reddit’s poor implementation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Solution: unearth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is called “unearth” and is currently in the early stages of development.
I chose unearth because it’s suppose to represent the action of “digging through
your saved content and finding gems you had forgotten about”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With unearth, I hope to alleviate the pain of discovering saved content for
Redditors by adding the basic tools like searching and filtering while also
bringing the ability to group content to those without Premium memberships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have more ambitious goals for unearth which I think others might enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;native reminder system (think u/RemindMeBot for those familiar with the account)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;email updates with featured saved posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backup system (importing and exporting of saved items)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those wondering, this would all be free and for the benefit of the users of
unearth. As of now, I have no intent of monetizing unearth and only want to
provide the best service possible for all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be asking, What’s my end goal? In an ideal world, I think it
would be amazing if the product team at Reddit came across unearth and decided
to improve Reddit’s save feature. If that doesn’t happen, I would be okay with
building this project and using it as leverage in order to land a job at Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to &lt;strong&gt;stay up to date with unearth’s development&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;get early beta

I hardly study, consistently skip class,
and often drop courses just to lighten my course load. Because of this seemingly
lazy behavior, I have been attending community college for nearly 3 years and
probably have at least another year before I can even think of transferring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before you write me off as a complete degenerate, let me explain why I do so
poorly. If I had to guess, you’re probably thinking I’m spending all my time
playing video games or dealing with difficult situation, but none of that is
true. Rather, I spend my free time (and the time I should be doing schoolwork)
working on side projects, programming whatever I think would be a neat
endeavor to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not many ppl know this about me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;programming is almost addictive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dramatic about academic performance (mention 2.99 GPA), but definitely not
comfortable with the rate of progress I’m making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..segways into…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not wanting to be in school for another 3+ years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;feeling stuck and the need to become independent / responsible for myself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mention how I’ve felt like a caged bird, only to be freed once I made the
decision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dear friends and family might think I’m making a mistake, so explain my plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;introduce Lambda School and how I heard about it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what I’m going to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue working part-time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enroll in LS part-time in Spring 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all goes well, graduate in Spring/Summer 2020 and start job hunt (full-time
software dev positions!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reiterate that I have no personal quarrel w/ higher-education (besides the
ridiculous cost) and I do plan on finishing my degree someday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank those close to me for being supportive and understanding as I begin this

For better or worse
(and advised as okay by Paul Graham), I’ve since pivoted the main topic of this
post to instead focus more generally on my motivation to create—be it via
writing, programming, designing, or drawing. But this post does not only focus
on the motivation why I do these activities, rather, it also looks at why I don’t
do these things when required of me, namely academically-speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- 
  Elaborate on why it was going to be &quot;why I write&quot; and how the shift in focus occurred
  &quot;why I write?&quot; turned into &quot;why do I partake in any creative endeavor?&quot;
  esp. since I should be doing so in school but ultimately don&apos;t
 --&gt;
&lt;!--
  Make note of why this is important - hopefully better understand myself
  and make the appropriate changes (makes sense with New Years right around the corner)
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, through the inquisition of myself and some research, this essay aims to
answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can lazy people, who do not apply themselves academically, pursue creative
and/or mentally-demanding endeavors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates these individuals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can said motivation be applied towards performing at a higher level academically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--
  Myself as case study
   - explain relationship w/ school
   - grades
   - general performance
--&gt;
&lt;!-- 
  With my own thoughts on the topic (refletion) &amp; answers from reddit,
  answer all three questions
 --&gt;
 &lt;!-- 
  With answers in mind, think about what can be changed and/or done differently
  in order to lead a better lifestyle in terms of school

outside of school and work. There’s something about getting to make whatever you
want while also having total ownership of a project that makes building side
projects so addicting. I’ve heard it compared to other hobbies such as gaming
or playing sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many side projects may go unfinished or unreleased,
I feel as though there is still a lot of experience to gain from simply starting
a project in the first place. In this post, I will walk you through my process
of coming up with an idea of what to make, taking said idea and turning it into
something tangible, to putting the project out in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, I will warn you that my process is by no means perfect. As I’ll
discuss later, there are a few things I would like to do differently in the future
since my current process of building side projects can seem anomalous at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Coming Up with an Idea 💡&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to build something, you first need an idea. I find this to be one of
the hardest parts of side projects. This is simply because if there is no idea,
there can’t be a project. To get around this potential roadblock, I like to
examine my own daily life and see what areas I could possibly speed up or
improve. Having intimate knowledge of the problem you’re trying to solve will
make building a side project that much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Preliminary Research 🧐&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have an idea in mind, I like to see what existing solutions already exist.
Now, if I find more than a few existing projects that solve the same issue that
I was hoping to tackle, then I usually will not continue with that project. This
is one of those situations that I mentioned earlier where I’m sort of peculiar—
the fact that there are already projects that try to solve an issue means that
your idea has already been validated—this is good news! Don’t be discouraged if
there are already other projects out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that if I do try to tackle such problems, I will often mimic the existing
projects’ solutions rather than building something unique. Although imitating one
project’s solution to help you solve an issue can be helpful, I have found that
relying too much on this method then makes it harder for me to build projects that
require unique and sophisticated solutions later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Choosing a Tech Stack 🥞&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have an idea and know I want to commit to this side project, the next
thing I do is research what tech stack I will use to turn the idea into a real
thing. This step assumes you’ve already determined the area or type of project
you are going to make—be it a browser extension, CLI tool, a web or mobile app,
etc. I love JavaScript and thanks to the run-time environment Node.js, I can make
projects as just about any application type. With the language selected, I then
will decide if I want to use any libraries that could help speed up the
development time and if I’m unfamiliar with a particular library, I will read
their documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Coding → MVP 🦴&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for the fun part: coding! With an idea in mind and the right tools selected
to build said idea, I get to work. Programming can be a double-edged sword when
creating a side project: when it’s going well, I love it. But when I get stuck on
an issue that I can’t immediately solve, I also really hate it. Throughout the
development process, these two emotions can cycle between overpowering one
another. At times, I feel so defeated by a bug and want to give up entirely only
to get the biggest boost of confidence after stepping away and figuring out how
to squash the bug. I like to say making side projects can be like war—it’s
essentially a series of battles composed of wins and losses, me versus my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I come out victorious and emerge with something that works and solves
the original problem. This will almost always be a minimum viable product, or MVP.
The MVP serves as the skeleton for the finished product without all the bells and
whistles that will eventually make it complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Break from Code—Design Time 🎨&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the step in the process where I like to start thinking about how I will
market my side project while also giving myself a break from coding. Like a
newborn baby, the project needs a name. This can be as simple or extravagant as
you would like. Once a name is selected, I think about branding. What will the
main colors of the project be? What graphic or logo can best represent this
project? What font? Having answers to those questions then allows me to put my
creativity to use. Using design software (I’m a big fan of Sketch), I will put
together a press kit or package of promotional material (namely good-looking
graphics) to be used later on for open graph meta tags or product launches on
sites like Product Hunt or Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wrapping Up 🎀&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seem like a long process yet? Luckily, we’re just about done. After my creative
sprint, I go back to programming and flesh out the MVP. On goes the remaining
features I thought would be useful and any bug fixes that are critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: there will always be bugs, so do not try to fix them all before launching
your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Launching 🚀&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, I have a finished product and I’m ready to show it to the world. With the
press kit I made earlier, I hit up several relevant subreddits to the project I
just made and create posts that describe what the project is, why I made it, and
where to find it. Posting on Reddit will give my project some exposure and
feedback that I can then use to fix or tweak before launching on Product Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Looking Ahead 🔭&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having gone through this entire process several times and starting the
process but not finishing many more times, I feel as though there is room
for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, deciding whether or not to build something based on the number of
existing projects is kind of silly. Even if there are many solutions out there,
your take and solution to the problem is unique and therefore could end up
being a better solution than all the other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it’s really important to get your project out in the hands of the public
as soon as possible as this will significantly improve your chances of actually
completing it. Too many times to count have I worked on a project in isolation
without letting others try it which resulted in a “failed” launch. This is simply
due to the fact that I assumed I knew what people would want, rather than actually
letting them tell me. A costly mistake if you’re hoping to have users other than
yourself use the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s in store? I hope to work on the above issues while also continually
improving the process I’ve since been following. I feel as though the side
projects I’ve made up until this point have been quite small in scope, so in the
future I also plan on taking on larger problems that require more complex
solutions. Finally, I would love to make something that I can monetize and earn
some extra side income from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I already have some goals for 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Advice for Beginners]]></title><description><![CDATA[Originally published on the r/learnprogrammig subreddit.

&lt;h4&gt;For those struggling and comparing themselves to others…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m right there with you. I’ve been programming for about three years now and
although I wouldn’t consider myself a beginner, I’m by no means an expert and
still feel like programming can be hard or that the code I write is shit. I
can’t help but see all of the other developers I follow on social media and
the projects they’re making and feel like I’ll never get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best advice I’ve heard until recently to dealing with this are sayings like
“don’t compare your beginning to someone else’s middle”. That makes sense and I
understood what it meant, but I was never really satisfied with when my “middle”
would manifest - I felt like no matter how many projects I made, I was not
progressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is until I heard Ira Glass’ advice for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, Glass describes the idea that there is a gap between our good taste
(the cool projects we aspire to one day write) and the stuff we actually make
(the code we write/the projects we’re actually making). The gap represents our
dissatisfaction with our work compared to the work that we aspire to someday
create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t summarize Glass’ words in their full glory but luckily the transcript
isn’t too long, so I’ll paste it below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, and I really wish somebody had&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;told this to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;it’s like there is this gap. For the first couple years that you’re making&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;stuff, what you’re making isn’t so good. It’s not that great. It’s trying to&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not that good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you’re making is kind&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;of a disappointment to you. A lot of people never get past that phase. They&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;quit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everybody I know who does interesting, creative work they went through years&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;making wasn’t as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Everybody goes through that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And if you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you gotta&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;every month you know you’re going to finish one story. It is only by going&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;through a volume of work that you’re going to catch up and close that gap.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And the work you’re making will be as good as your ambitions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;takes awhile. It’s gonna take you a while. It’s normal to take a while.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You just have to fight your way through that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Ira Glass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure about you, but this explanation about the pursuit of evolving our
creativity made me have a light bulb moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Glass perfectly describes why we shouldn’t “compare our beginning to
someone else’s middle” while at the same time sheds light on the true struggle
we as beginners go through while honing our creative skills (such as programming).
I also felt like the idea to create a volume of work in order to close the gap
really goes in hand with Malcolm Gladwell’s “10,000-Hour Rule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the wall of text, I’ll stop here. If you’re more of a visual
learner, the comic Zen Pencils has an excellent interpretation of Ira Glass’
words.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Happy coding and hopefully some of you will
have found this as insightful as I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m ecstatic that so many of you have found this advice helpful. I
made Glass’ advice into a nice little r/GetMotivated-esque poster.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Rather, I’ve moved my blog. My first blog,
&lt;em&gt;coffee. code. cedric&lt;/em&gt;, was hosted on Medium when that was the cool thing to do.
I even had a custom domain for my publication before that
&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487%0A-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation&quot;&gt;feature was steamrolled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I struggled with keeping the blog up-to-date. In many of my posts,
I would make commitments to write more often which turned out to never come true.
Not only that, I felt as though I had limited myself in the number of topics I
could write about since the original blog was geared towards programming and
Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when my old domain expired and the link to my Medium publication broke, I
decided to not fix it and instead told myself that I will host my own blog. Along
with that, I also made the decision to not limit myself in the type of content I
write about. What does that mean for this blog then? Well, anything goes. Be it
related to programming, philosophy, design, or my day, I won’t think twice and
worry about whether or not a post should belong on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I pretty much failed at having a blog before, I do enjoy writing (even
if I’m bad at it) and hope this blog will allow me to pursue this passion further.
So for now, I bid you adieu and I look forward to see where things go from here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
